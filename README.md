# Campus indoor/ outdoor navigation <img align="right" src="https://github.com/Ch-W3st/backstein/blob/master/logo.png">

Based on react native, we built up the first indoor/ outdoor navigation app for the HTW campus in Berlin.

## What's the deal?

Are you new as a student at the campus or just a visitor? This app will guide you!

## How? I can use google maps!

With the help of **Indoor Atlas** we mapped all levels, so indoor positioning is accurate **up to 2 meters**.
A magnetic field and wifi-signals from every router on the levels deserves us with information which makes indoor positioning as accurate as it can be. Google maps is not very helpful when it's going down to indoor navigation.

## What is the map like?

**Mapbox** serves. Within **Mapbox** we created our unique maps and adjust the styles, to the persons needs.
The map is interactive and alows you to zoom in / zoom out, change the perspective (angle), rooms are clickable and you will receive more information e.g. is this room occupied or free to use, the room type and the building. You are also able to add this room to your favorites, to make a quick search.

## Show me what you got!

As a user you will get everthing you need to feel welcome and find everything you need.
All features are listed below.

### How can I find what I am looking for?

We integrated a search which can find any room you want to navigate to. 
You are able to find the room of your next lecture, the office of any professor and also points of interests e.g. 
changing rooms, printers, snacks & coffee mashine.

### How to get there?

With a click on the navigation buttom, it will take your actual position and navigates you to the place of choice, no matter if it's indoor or outdoor. Your position will be centered and the path will be displayed on the map on the same floor. You will also receive infromation about the estimated time and distance to travel.
Depending on the settings of your choice, you will eighter take the lift or the stairs. 
A marker will show you where to get off and the second part of the path will show you the way of your desired room.


### Really, there is still more?

We want to have all features combined in one app, so we decided to add one more feature to the app. You are now up to date with the menue in the canteen.
